Edgar Allen Poe Novel revised 

This project was hard for me to change, I really like the concept and the way that it turned out so I decided to try and rework the pdf. I completely forgot to add the pdf in my original verizon of this novel so I decided to add it in here. I tried to change the fonts but I really couldn't figure it out so I just stuck with making sure the chapters were in the right places and the names of the chapters weren't the ones from the original example. 

If I knew how to change to font I would definitely do that but I was never really quite sure how to change from Merriweather.
